##Guess the Number

**Description:**

This repository hosts an advanced implementation of the classic "Guess the Number" game using C++. The game offers players the option to choose from five difficulty levels, ranging from easy to challenging, each affecting the range of numbers to guess. Players can guess numbers within a dynamically generated range based on their chosen difficulty level and receive immediate feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.

**Key Features:**

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Choose from 5 different difficulty levels, each increasing the challenge by expanding the range of possible numbers to guess.
  
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Engage in a user-friendly console interface that guides players through each round, prompting them to enter their guesses and providing real-time feedback.

- **Score Tracking:** Accumulate points based on the difficulty level chosen and the number of attempts taken to correctly guess the number. The score is displayed at the end of each game session.

- **Replayability:** Enjoy endless rounds of gameplay with the option to play again after each session, maintaining a continuous challenge and allowing improvement in guessing skills.

- **Educational Purpose:** Ideal for beginners learning C++ fundamentals such as random number generation, conditional statements, user input handling, and basic game logic implementation.

**Usage:**

To play the game:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `guess_number_advanced.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the prompts to choose a difficulty level, guess the number, and see your score.
